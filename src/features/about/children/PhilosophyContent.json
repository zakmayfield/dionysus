  "content": [
    "Our juices are made from all-natural, fresh ingredients with no sugars or preservatives added. Because fresh is best, we begin each day at 7am creating all of our juice orders so we can deliver them to you that very same day. Our goal is to provide our clients and the public with fresh, healthy, unpasteurized and raw juices made of all-natural, real ingredients. We rely on the natural flavours of the fruits, vegetables, herbs and in-house made syrups we use in our products. We do not add any additional flavour or colour enhancers because we think the natural flavour of our juices speak for itself, they donâ€™t need anything extra. Chasers Juice is a fresh juice experience!",
    "Chasers Fresh Juice is also committed to finding new and innovative ways to limit the amount of waste produced every day. All of our biological waste from the fruits and vegetables we juice is not disposed of or composted but instead we have sourced a company that recycles and renews the biological waste into electrical energy. We also encourage our customers to allow us to use our coloured plastic bottle caps rather then black caps. This is because black coloured plastic is unable to be recycled in the city of Toronto, so 90% of the caps we use are coloured so they can be properly recycled."
